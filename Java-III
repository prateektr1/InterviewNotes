Concurrent HashMap is a part of Java.util.concurrent package
Concurrent hashmap are better performance wise when compared to normal syhchronized collections
The reason is in synchronized collections the entire collection is locked whereas in synchronized collection the concept of segment locking
is there

Terms Used in Concurrent Hash Map

Concurrency level : It is the number of Threads currently updating the map, the implementation performs internal sizing to try to accomodate this Threads. Default is 
16.

Load Factor : Its a factor that is used to control resizing, default value is 0.75, its a threshold

Initial Capacity : Its initial Capacity is 16

In ConcurrentHashMap , at a time any number of threads can perform retrieval operation but for updated in the object, the thread must lock the particular segment
in which the Thread wants to operate, this type of locking mechanism is known as segment locking or bucket locking, Hence at a time 16 update operations can be
performed by threads.

private, static and final methods can not be overridden in Java
