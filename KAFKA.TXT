NO Kafka server can run without a zookeeper server , it is mandatory to run the zookeeper server

Apache Kafka is a publish subscribed based fault tolerant messaging system , it is fast , scalable and distributed by design

Differences between Active MQ/Rabbit MQ and Kafka

kafka is based upon pub sub (publish subscribe model), Apache kafka allows publishing and subscribing
to stream of records/ Active MQ is based upon PTP messaging ( Point to Point messaging system)

Kafka is written in Java and scala / Active MQ is written in Java , Rabbit MQ is writeen in erlang

Kafka mostly deals with large amount of data/ Rabbit mq deals with small amount of data

We use kafka for high performance monitoring and where losing messages is not important / Use them for exactly once delivery and for valuing messages

When you can manage to lose messages go for kafka when you cant manage to lose go for Rabbit MQ

Kafka has a higher throughput as it does no wait for acknowledgement from the broker , so brokers can write messages at a very high rate/
Active MQ or Rabbit mq have lower throughput as each delivery state is maintained

kafka can assure that it can preserve the order in which messages were sent/ Active MQ or Rabbit MQ cant assure the order of messages to remain same
