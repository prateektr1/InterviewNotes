API GATEWAY IS A LAYER BETWEEN CLIENT AND MICROSERVICES

Api gateway acts like a proxy that routes the request to appropriate microservices and returns a response to the client.Microservices can also interact with each other through this gateway.

With API gateway we can centralise common functionalities like authentication, logging and authrization. Now API Gateway will authenticate all requests hence microservices
need not implement all these , thus it reduces the code redundancy.

API gateway works on the concept of Routing

Some Most Popular API gateways are as follows

1) Netflix API gateway (ZUUL)
2) Amazon API gateway
3) Mulesoft
4) Kong API gateway
5) Azure API gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway is a non blocking API gateway.
