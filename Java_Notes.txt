The finalize method in Object class has been deprecated Java 9 Onwards
Examples of Immutable classes in Java are String and all the wrapper classes like Integer,Float,Boolean etc

Here's what we need to do to create an immutable class.

declare the class as final so it cannot be extended
all class members should be private so they cannot be accessed outside of class
shouldn't contain any setter methods to change the value of class members
the getter method should return the copy of class members
class members are only initialized using constructor

final class Immutable {

  // private class members
  private String name;
  private int date;

  Immutable(String name, int date) {

    // class members are initialized using constructor
    this.name = name;
    this.date = date;
  }

  // getter method returns the copy of class members
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getDate() {
    return date;
  }

}



==============================================================


Collection is an interface
Collections is a class

Interface like List,Set and queue implement the collection interface
The map interface does not implement the collection interface
