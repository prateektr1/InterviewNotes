Java 8 was introduced to reduce the lines of code in Java, it also marks the begining of functional programming in java and gives it the power of languages
similar to scala and python.

All the predefined Java 8 inetrfaces are present in Java.util.Function package

if we want we can also define our own Functional interface

Functional interfaces follow SAM(Single abstract method) policy

Any functional interface can have any number of static and default methods , but as far as abstract methods are concerned it can have only one
example : Runnable,Comparable
