Round 2 Interview Questions

Questions again around design patterns in Microservices

Questions from the document given by Recruiter


Intro? Tech stack?
Question: List of integers and there is a target number. Find the pair of integers from the list whose sum is equal to the target number. Use java 8 features and write efficient code.
 how would you handle duplicate pairs like for example 2, comma 8 or 8 comma two? how would you ensure that two comma eight and eight comma two are treated as the same pair?
Additional Questions – 
1.how will you do exception handling for this program? What all things need to be handled?
2.how will you ensure that you cater to large number of input list. Suppose the input is in thousands. How would you ensure the performance of the program?

Another question: When you log in to travel websites, for ticket booking and all those things right you do sorting from you do the sorting by distance you ultimately get the list of flights right from the website and it gives you The sorting by the price or distance or Any other filtrations you have added. So this is currently the implementation where they have put in like getting the flights, they have a single function right and they are using switch cases for you for it. How would you like consider implementing it in a more better way Such that there is no changes in your main API class.. How will you try to achieve the solid principles here? what all components will you create? What interface will you create? What classes you will create? What all methods you will apply? How your structure would look like.?
which design pattern according to you is the best fit here.?




Can you explain the spring boot annotations and bean life cycle?

how do you define or  instantiate a Singleton class in springboot.?
what is a circuit breaker and why it is needed? Have you heard of hystrix or resilience4j?  I just want to understand like if you have a springboot application, h what annotations are used to implement circuit breaker pattern?
how can transactions be managed across multiple microservices?
Which databases have you worked on? suppose I have two tables and I want to try and find the common records across both the tables, so which joins will you use? And if you want everything except the the common or the intersection, then what query you will use?
What do you mean by correlated queries?
Any cloud services you have used? Any service you would like to elaborate and why have you used it?
Any certifications you have done?

Connecting Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with AWS Cognito involves configuring Azure AD as an identity provider for AWS Cognito. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### Prerequisites:
1. An active Azure subscription with Azure AD.
2. An AWS account with access to AWS Cognito.

### Step 1: Register an Application in Azure AD
1. **Sign in to the Azure portal**.
2. **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**.
3. **Select "App registrations"** and then **"New registration"**.
4. **Enter a name for the application**, and for the "Supported account types," select **"Accounts in this organizational directory only"** (for a single tenant) or **"Accounts in any organizational directory"** (for multi-tenant).
5. For the **redirect URI**, select **"Web"** and enter a placeholder URL (you will update this later).
6. **Click "Register"**.

### Step 2: Configure the Registered Application
1. In the app registration, go to **"Authentication"**.
2. Under **"Redirect URIs"**, add the redirect URL from AWS Cognito (you'll get this URL from AWS Cognito's setup).
3. Enable **"ID tokens"**.
4. **Save** the changes.
5. Go to **"Certificates & secrets"** and create a new **"Client secret"**. Note down the secret value, as it will be needed later.
6. Under **"API permissions"**, add the required permissions for the application (typically, "openid", "profile", and "email" under Microsoft Graph).

### Step 3: Configure AWS Cognito
1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. Go to **Cognito** and select the **user pool** you want to integrate with Azure AD.
3. In the user pool, go to **"Federation"** and then **"Identity providers"**.
4. Select **"OpenID Connect"**.
5. Fill in the following details:
   - **Provider name**: A name for the provider (e.g., "AzureAD").
   - **Client ID**: The application (client) ID from Azure AD.
   - **Client secret**: The client secret you generated in Azure AD.
   - **Issuer**: The issuer URL, which is typically `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0` (replace `{tenant}` with your Azure AD tenant ID).
   - **Authorize scope**: `openid profile email`.
6. **Save** the provider.

### Step 4: Update Redirect URIs in Azure AD
1. Go back to your Azure AD app registration.
2. Navigate to **"Authentication"**.
3. Update the **redirect URI** to include the redirect URL provided by AWS Cognito. It typically looks like `https://<your_cognito_domain>/oauth2/idpresponse`.
4. **Save** the changes.

### Step 5: Set Up the Cognito User Pool Client
1. In AWS Cognito, go to **"App clients"**.
2. Select your app client or create a new one.
3. Under **"Hosted UI"**, ensure the callback URL includes the redirect URI you've set up in Azure AD.
4. Enable **OAuth 2.0** grants (typically, "Authorization code grant" and "Implicit grant").
5. Configure the **sign-in** and **sign-out** URLs appropriately.
6. Save the app client settings.

### Step 6: Test the Integration
1. Go to the **Cognito Hosted UI URL** for your user pool (you can find this in the AWS Cognito console).
2. Choose to sign in using the Azure AD identity provider you configured.
3. You should be redirected to the Azure AD sign-in page.
4. Sign in with an Azure AD account.
5. After successful authentication, you should be redirected back to your application or the Cognito Hosted UI.

### Summary
This process establishes Azure AD as an identity provider for AWS Cognito, allowing users to authenticate using their Azure AD credentials. Ensure that you carefully manage secrets and configurations to maintain the security and integrity of the authentication process.
