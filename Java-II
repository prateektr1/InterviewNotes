How can the microservices communicate with each other,

There are 2 modes of communication for microservices

1) Synchronous communication : Takes place via HTTP(Clients Like Rest Template,Feign Client and Postman help in this), we should try to minimise this type of communication
   because they introduce latency in network.
2) Asynchronous communication : Takes place via messaging queues like Kafka,Rabbit MQ etc,Client does not wait for response here

When to use Linked List and Array List

Linked List are better to use for Update Operations
Array Lists are better for Search Operations(Due to the undelying data structure being Resizable Array and indexed based access in Linked List we will have to iterarate 
through the entire list)
