There are 3 types of Design Patters

Creational Design Pattern
Structural Design Pattern
Behvioural Design Pattern

The Choice of a specific design pattern depends upon our specific requirement

Types of design patterns
There are about 26 Patterns currently discovered (I hardly think I will do them allâ€¦).

These 26 can be classified into 3 types:

1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

In this post, we will go through one basic design pattern for each classified type.
