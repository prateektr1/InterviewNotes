As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call . 
GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. 
GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or discard fields without affecting existing queries.


Rather creating a separate end point everytime for getting different fields we can use graph QL, postman too has an option of Graph QL
