As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call . 
GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. 
GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or discard fields without affecting existing queries.


Rather creating a separate end point everytime for getting different fields we can use graph QL, postman too has an option of Graph QL

Unlike REST, which typically uses multiple endpoints to fetch data and perform network operations, GraphQL exposes data models by using a single endpoint through which clients send GraphQL requests , regardless of what they're asking for.
