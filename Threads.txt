2. Callable

A Future represents a Future Result of an asynchronous operation

The Future interface, part of the java. util. concurrent package represents the result of an asynchronous computation. A Future object returns from a computation when it is complete, but the computation itself runs in a separate thread, allowing the program to continue doing other work in the meantime

COMPUTATION state of future can be Running , Success, Failed, Cancelled
