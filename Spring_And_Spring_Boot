We use Spring Framework to Instantiate beans and wire dependencies // known as Dependency Injection
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.
// Inversion of control means the responsibility of creation of objects goes to the Spring framework (Mostly using the @Autowire annotation), not like the class which 
has the object creating the object

There are 2 types of IOC containers

1) Bean Factory
2) Application Context

bean factory is mostly used by low memory applications like mobile phones

The configuration for application context can be defined in 2 ways

1) @Configuration annotation
2) using configuration.xml file
