We use Spring Framework to Instantiate beans and wire dependencies // known as Dependency Injection
Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.
// Inversion of control means the responsibility of creation of objects goes to the Spring framework (Mostly using the @Autowire annotation), not like the class which 
has the object creating the object
