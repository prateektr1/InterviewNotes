JWT stands for Json Web Token, its a compact and self contained way to represent information between 2 parties
typically used for transmitting secure information between a client and a server or between different services 
within a system.

JWTs are used for authentication and authorization scenarios.

A JWT is a string which is separated by three dots(.), x.y.z

x part is the header
y part is the claim
z part is the signature

Header : Header contains of 2 parts a) token type b) the signing algo like HMAC, sha256 or RSA

Payload : The second part of the token contains the claims , claims are statements about an entity(typically the user)
and additional data. There are 3 types of claims registered, public and private claims.

signature : signature is created using the header and payload only...to create signature take the encoded header, encoded
payload, a secret and algorithm specified in the payload and sign that.

signature is used to check the authenticity of the JWT token.

A jwt token can be signed with

secret key(HMAC algorithm)
public/private key pair (RSA algorithm)

the signature ensures the integrity of the token and allows the recieving party to verify
that the token was not tampered with.

JWTs are advantageous because they are compact, URL safe and can be  easily transmitted as url params
in HTTP headers or within cookies.They are widely supported by programming languages and platforms

==========================================================================================================

When you sign in to a site with a username and password, or with a third party method like Google, you're proving who you are with those sensitive details or access. This process is called authentication.

Once you're signed in, the site's server sends back a JWT that allows you access to things like your settings page, shopping cart, and so on. This process is called authorization.

You send your JWT to the server with each request. When the server receives it, it generates a signature using using some data from your JWT, verifies it, and if your JWT is valid, it sends back a response.

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a standardized way to securely send data between two parties. They contain information (claims) encoded in the JSON format. These claims help share specific details between the parties involved. At its core, a JWT is a mechanism for verifying the authenticity of some JSON data.
