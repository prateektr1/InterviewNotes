Spring Security Secures our application using authorization and authentication

The first step to add spring security in our application is to add the following dependency

<artifactId> spring-boot-starter-security </artifactId>

WebSecurityConfigAdapter class is responsible for imparting security to Spring Boot application

Basic Authentication in Spring Security is done using Authentication manager.

We can use this method although this is not a very good way , we can define these 2 props in properties file 

spring.security.user.name=cat
spring.security.user.password=cat

THis way we can define our own username and password and avoid the logs or spring to generate password
