Spring Security Secures our application using authorization and authentication

The first step to add spring security in our application is to add the following dependency

<artifactId> spring-boot-starter-security </artifactId>

WebSecurityConfigAdapter class is responsible for imparting security to Spring Boot application

Basic Authentication in Spring Security is done using Authentication manager.

We can use this method although this is not a very good way , we can define these 2 props in properties file 

spring.security.user.name=cat
spring.security.user.password=cat

THis way we can define our own username and password and avoid the logs or spring to generate password

Although the above method is depracated , the websecurity configadapter is depracated in spring 5.4

Now the same task happens via creation of beans whose examples have been given below

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> authz
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .httpBasic(withDefaults());
        return http.build();
    }

}


@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public WebSecurityCustomizer webSecurityCustomizer() {
        return (web) -> web.ignoring().antMatchers("/ignore1", "/ignore2");
    }

}

                                             Notes About Oauth2 

Its on open standard or a Protocol for Authorization
Outh2 is strictly meant for Authorization not meant for Authentication

Ouath2 is an authorization framework that enables application such as facebook , Twitter to obtain limited access to accounts
on an HTTP service.

It works by delegating user authentication to the service thats hosts a user account and authorizing third party
applications to access that user account.

There are 2 Versions of OAuth version 1 and Version 2 although there is no backward compatibility between them
These 2 specifications are completely different from one another

                                                      Notes About OKTA

Okta is a one stop solution for Authentication and Authorization of users
It is actually a Company that develops such solutions

Okta Just says that you don't need to configure anything locally you just need to configure your application using okta
then a series of endpoints are provided by okta to do the process of authentication and authorization.

Okta is an organisation that does authentication and authorization on our behalf
